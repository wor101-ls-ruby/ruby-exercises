# The Enumerable#each_with_index method iterates over the members of a collection, passing each element and its index to the associated block. 
# The value returned by the block is not used. each_with_index returns a reference to the original collection.

# Write a method called each_with_index that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. 
# It should yield each element and an index number to the block. each_with_index should return a reference to the original Array.

# Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, 
# but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.


def each_with_index(array)
  index = 0
  while index < array.size
    yield(array[index], index)
    index += 1
  end
  array
end



result = each_with_index([1, 3, 6]) do |value, index|
  puts "#{index} -> #{value**index}"
end

puts result == [1, 3, 6]


# Output:
# 0 -> 1
# 1 -> 3
# 2 -> 36
# true

# alt - takes advantage of #each method always returning the original array

# def each_with_index(array)
#   index = 0
#   array.each do |item|
#     yield(item, index)
